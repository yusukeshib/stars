# Progress

This document is the implementation log for `stars`. It records what has been
implemented well enough to count as shipped. The forward-looking plan lives in
[`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md).

A feature belongs here when it is implemented, documented in the relevant code
or docs, covered by tests where numerical output matters, and wired into the
relevant host applications.

## Summary

Implemented phase groups:

- Phase 1 core educational overlays and text labels.
- Phase 1' physical dark-sky visual pipeline.
- Phase 2 time systems, apparent-place corrections, atmosphere, solar-system
  bodies, and planning UI.
- Phase 4 full-sky projections.

Still open:

- Phase 3 research / platform features.
- Remaining Phase 4 advanced visual features.

## Phase 1 — Educational planetarium

  overlay, planning, atmosphere, and session sections.
- Web overlay controls grouped by reference geometry, constellations, labels,
  and line styling.

### Text labels

Implemented a shared label renderer that projects sky positions into
screen-space, applies a simple collision/priority pass, and draws text from a
built-in bitmap font atlas after tone mapping.

Shipped capabilities:

  designations generated from HYG v4.2;
- Sun, Moon, and Mercury-through-Neptune labels from the renderer apparent-body uniforms;

- `crates/renderer/build.rs`
- host overlay controls in `apps/cli`, `apps/viewer`, and `apps/web`

## Phase 1' — Physical dark-sky visual pipeline

Phase 1' is implemented as the dark-sky visual realism layer. It is orthogonal
to positional precision: the goal is that the sky looks physically plausible to
a dark-adapted observer.

### Photometry and colour

Implemented:

- magnitude to physical illuminance scale;
- mesopic chromatic-fidelity weighting;
- scotopic / Purkinje-shifted desaturation for faint stars;

  colour pipeline;
- perceptual star instance generation for renderer input.

Primary implementation areas:

- `crates/astronomy/src/photometry.rs`
- `crates/catalog/src/color.rs`
- `crates/renderer/src/vertex.rs`

### HDR, glare, and tone reproduction

Implemented:

- HDR render target;
- Spencer-style eye PSF / glare approximation;
- ciliary corona support;
- adaptive Reinhard-style tone reproduction;

Primary implementation areas:

- `crates/renderer/src/tonemap.rs`
- `crates/renderer/src/pipeline.rs`
- `crates/renderer/src/renderer.rs`
- `crates/renderer/src/shaders/*` where generated / included by renderer code

### Atmosphere and night-sky background

Implemented:

- Kasten-Young airmass;
- per-channel extinction coefficients;
- diffuse sky background fit;
- Milky Way / integrated starlight style contribution;
- zodiacal light;
- gegenschein;
- airglow floor;
- analytic dust extinction;
- Rust reference models and shader-side evaluation.

Primary implementation areas:

- `crates/astronomy/src/skyglow.rs`
- `crates/astronomy/src/photometry.rs`
- `crates/renderer/src/skyglow.rs`

## Phase 2 — Observation planning and positional trust

Phase 2 is implemented in the roadmap table. It provides the default precision
and physical atmosphere layer expected of the current viewer.

### Time systems

Implemented explicit time scales:

- UTC for civil input;
- UT1 for Earth rotation;
- TAI and TT through the built-in leap-second table;
- approximate TDB for ephemeris use;
- optional DUT1 handling.

Primary implementation areas:

- `crates/astronomy/src/time.rs`
- `crates/astronomy/src/observer.rs`
- host time parsing in `crates/common`

### Stellar apparent-place corrections

Implemented renderer-wired corrections:

- proper motion from catalog data;
- IAU 2006 precession;
- compact IAU-2000-style nutation;
- equation-of-equinoxes sidereal-time wiring;
- first-order annual aberration;
- pressure / temperature scaled atmospheric refraction.

Primary implementation areas:

- `crates/astronomy/src/corrections.rs`
- `crates/renderer/src/camera.rs`
- `crates/renderer/src/vertex.rs`
- star shader path in `crates/renderer`

### Solar-system bodies

Implemented apparent / topocentric rendering inputs for:

- Sun;
- Moon;
- Mercury;
- Venus;
- Mars;
- Jupiter;
- Saturn;

The renderer receives apparent directions, angular sizes, phase information, and
body state suitable for visual rendering.

Primary implementation areas:

- `crates/astronomy/src/ephemeris.rs`
- `crates/renderer/src/camera.rs`
- `crates/renderer/src/skyglow.rs`
- host controls in `apps/cli`, `apps/viewer`, and `apps/web`

### Moon phase and Earth-shadow aid

Implemented renderer-driven Moon phase and lunar-eclipse umbral darkening aid.
This is intended as visual support, not a final eclipse-prediction product.

Primary implementation areas:

- `crates/astronomy/src/ephemeris.rs`
- `crates/renderer/src/skyglow.rs`

### Solar / lunar illuminants and physical sky colour

Implemented:

- solar irradiance / daylight-basis style illuminant values;
- lunar phase photometry for moonlight;
- Rayleigh / Mie / ozone-inspired daylight sky model;
- twilight radiance model continuous across civil, nautical, and astronomical
  bands;
- additive composition of sunlit sky, moonlit sky, and dark-sky background;
- atmosphere controls for turbidity, observer altitude, ozone, visibility,
  pressure, and temperature.

Primary implementation areas:

- `crates/astronomy/src/illuminants.rs`
- `crates/astronomy/src/atmosphere.rs`
- `crates/astronomy/src/skyglow.rs`
- `crates/renderer/src/camera.rs`

- `apps/cli`, `apps/viewer`, `apps/web`

### Planning UI

Implemented web planning helpers and UI for:

- local-evening rise / transit / set table;
- Sun, Moon, and planet planning objects;
- civil / nautical / astronomical twilight indicators;
- session URLs using plain query parameters, with no version gate.

Primary implementation areas:

- `crates/astronomy/src/planning.rs`
- `apps/web/frontend`

## Phase 4 — Advanced visual features

### Full-sky projections

Implemented the first Phase 4 visual feature: selectable screen projections.
Perspective remains the default camera projection, and three all-sky map modes
are available for structure-scale views:

- Mollweide;
- Aitoff;
- Hammer.

The all-sky modes map the entire celestial sphere into a 2:1 ellipse fitted to
the framebuffer, keep azimuth / altitude as the map centre, and ignore the
perspective FoV slider. The skyglow / daylight / twilight pass reconstructs
rays through the inverse selected map projection, while stars and overlays use
the corresponding forward projection.

Primary implementation areas:

- `renderer::SkyProjection` and camera projection uniforms;
- `crates/renderer/src/shaders/star.wgsl`;
- `crates/renderer/src/shaders/skyglow.wgsl`;
- `crates/renderer/src/shaders/overlay.wgsl`;
- projection controls in `apps/cli`, `apps/viewer`, and `apps/web`.

Validation:

- renderer unit tests pin projection string round-trips, all-sky map fitting,
  and average all-sky pixel solid angle;
- host-common tests pin native CLI enum mapping;
- smoke renders cover perspective, Mollweide, Aitoff, and Hammer shader paths.

## Documentation progress

The documentation has been split into purpose-specific files:

- `README.md` / `README.ja.md` for entry points;
- `ROADMAP.md` for forward plan;
- `PROGRESS.md` for implementation log;
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` for crate boundaries and host integration;
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` for development process;
- `VALIDATION.md` for scientific validation policy;
- `DATA_SOURCES.md` for data provenance.

## Next implementation log entries

When new work lands, add a short entry here with:

1. what changed;
2. why it counts as complete;
3. where the implementation lives;
4. what tests or validation pin the behaviour;
5. which hosts are wired, if applicable.
